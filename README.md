This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of loan applicants, containing approximately 250,000 rows and 18 columns, to predict loan defaults. The analysis began with thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and identify any issues. The data was confirmed to be outlier-free, and extensive data visualization was performed to uncover key trends and patterns. Following this, I applied data normalization and addressed skewness using a quantile transformer to ensure a balanced dataset. Feature engineering was carried out to enhance the model's predictive power. For feature scaling, Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation was used to maintain data integrity across different folds. The predictive model was built using a Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieving a balanced accuracy of 89% for both training and testing sets. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, showcasing advanced techniques to tackle loan default prediction effectively.
